"""SSE event stream for a chat turn (§10.14, API-004).

The turn is computed up front (retrieval + verification are not token-streamed), then the verified
answer is emitted progressively as `token` events, followed by a `citations` event once the answer
completes and a terminal `done` event with the turn's metadata — so the UI shows text appearing and
citations resolving as the answer finishes, over a verified result (never raw model tokens).
