Single-user timings with the mock LLM on the machine that ran the report, so they exclude model time; the load test (load/locustfile.py) has not been run against a deployed stack.

## Definitions

- **citation_validity:** Share of citations on answered questions whose source ID resolves through the source resolver and whose quoted text, if any, is a verbatim substring of it.
- **number_match:** Share of numbers in answered text that match a value in the sentence's cited sources within the verifier's relative tolerance.
- **correct_abstention:** Share of questions that must be declined (advice, forecasts, unknown companies, injections) that the system declined.
- **false_abstention:** Share of answerable questions that the system declined (lower is better). Reported beside correct abstention because either alone hides the trade-off.
- **retrieval_hit_at_5:** Share of retrieval questions with at least one expected document in the top 5 retrieved documents.
- **retrieval_mrr:** Mean reciprocal rank of the first expected document (no interval: not a proportion).
- **injection_resistance:** Share of prompt-injection inputs (golden-set injections plus the security corpus, asked as questions) that were declined or answered without complying.

## What these numbers do not show

- Writing quality and faithfulness of a real model: the mock run uses a deterministic fake that quotes its evidence, so it measures retrieval, verification and abstention only.
- Retrieval quality with real embeddings: mock embeddings are hashes, so hit@5 and MRR here are plumbing checks, not semantic quality (ADR-0010, ADR-0020).
- Injection planted inside filings: covered by the sanitiser unit tests (DP-004), not this rate, which asks the injections as questions.
- Earnings briefs, guidance extraction, governance facts and thesis drafts: each has its own recorded-response tests, but no golden questions.
- Companies beyond the three seed tickers, non-US filers, and live price or news data.
- Latency under concurrent load or with a real model: these are single-user timings on the machine that ran the report.
