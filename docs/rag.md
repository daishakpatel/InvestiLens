# RAG — Embeddings & Indexes (Phase 2b)

How `document_chunks` get embedded and how the two retrieval indexes are configured. Fusion,
reranking, query rewriting, and orchestration are Phase 2c and are **not** covered here. Sources:
spec §16.4, §22.4 (EMB-001…004), ADR-0010 (model), ADR-0013 (migration + tuning).

## Embedding model (ADR-0010)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Provider / model | Voyage AI `voyage-finance-2` |
| Dimension | 1024 (fixed) — `vector(1024)` column |
| `input_type` | `document` at index time, `query` at search time |
| Vectors | L2-normalized (cosine == the index metric) |
| Batch size | 128 inputs/request (Voyage cap) |

Each chunk stores `embedding`, `embedding_model`, and `embedding_dim` (EMB-001) so a corpus can
hold mixed-model rows and re-embedding stays safe. `PROVIDER_MODE=mock` uses deterministic,
offline hash vectors of the same dimension; `live` uses Voyage (`VOYAGE_API_KEY` required, raises
if missing).

## Generation pipeline (EMB-002)

`app/embeddings/pipeline.py::embed_pending` reads chunks missing a vector for the active model,
embeds them in batches, and writes vectors back with their model + dim. **Every batch is logged to
`llm_calls`** (`purpose = "embedding"`) with token count, cost, and latency — the same cost table
used for chat completions, so embedding spend is tracked project-wide. Token counts come from
Voyage's reported usage when available, else the project `~4 chars/token` estimator (cost column
only; no financial output depends on it). Run: `cd backend && uv run python ../scripts/embed_chunks.py`.

## Re-embedding / model migration (EMB-003, ADR-0013)

Zero-downtime swap, in `app/embeddings/reembed.py`:

1. **Stage** — `stage_all` embeds every chunk under the new model into the `embedding_new` staging
   column. The live `embedding` column keeps serving reads the whole time. Resumable: only
   un-staged rows are embedded.
2. **Swap** — `swap` runs one atomic `UPDATE` promoting staged vectors to `embedding` and stamping
   the new `embedding_model` / `embedding_dim`, then clears staging. Only rows that were staged are
   touched, so a crash mid-backfill never loses data.

`migrate_model` runs both. A model with a **different dimension** requires a separate column-retype
migration (see ADR-0013); the swap mechanism assumes a dimension-preserving change (both Voyage
models are 1024-dim).

## Indexes

### Vector — HNSW cosine (EMB-004)

Index: `ix_document_chunks_embedding_hnsw` on `embedding`, `vector_cosine_ops`.

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| `m` | 16 | pgvector default; graph degree is ample for a tens-of-thousands-chunk MVP corpus and keeps build fast. |
| `ef_construction` | 64 | pgvector default; good recall/build-time balance at this scale. |
| `ef_search` | 100 (per query) | Raised from the default 40 for better recall at negligible latency on this corpus; set `SET LOCAL hnsw.ef_search` per query so it can vary by query class. |

Values are revisited in the Phase 5b retrieval evals against measured recall/latency on the full
corpus. `ef_search` is `app.config.hnsw_ef_search` (default 100).

### Keyword — full-text GIN

Index: `ix_document_chunks_tsv` (GIN) on the generated `tsv` column
(`to_tsvector('english', text)`). Queries use `websearch_to_tsquery('english', …)` so English
stemming lets exact financial terms match differently-phrased queries ("gross margin" ↔ "gross
margins", "restricted cash", "deferred revenue", "customer concentration"). This is the safety net
for exact-term recall that pure semantic search can miss.

### Usage

`app/rag/search.py` exposes `vector_search`, `vector_search_by_vector`, and `keyword_search` —
each over **one** index, company-scoped (RAG-013). Combining them (RRF fusion, reranking) is the
Phase 2c pipeline below.

---

# Retrieval pipeline (Phase 2c)

`app/rag/pipeline.py::run_retrieval(session, question=, ticker=)` returns a `RetrievalResult`:
ranked `Evidence` (each with a backend-issued `source_id`, typed anchor, scores, metadata), an
assembled context block, and a `sufficient` flag. It **generates no answer** — that is Phase
3a/3b/3c. Sources: §16, ADR-0003 (custom orchestration), ADR-0014 (reranker).

## Stages (§16.1)

1. **Intent classification** (`intent.py`, RAG-002) — rule-based, fixed label set, logged. Labels:
   `FINANCIAL_METRIC`, `RISK_ANALYSIS`, `FINANCIAL_EXPLANATION`, `DOCUMENT_SUMMARY`,
   `MANAGEMENT_COMMENTARY`, `COMPARISON`, `FILING_DIFF`, `OUT_OF_SCOPE_ADVICE`, `OUT_OF_SCOPE`.
   Advice/out-of-scope abstain before any retrieval.
2. **Query rewriting** (`rewrite.py`, RAG-003) — expand financial synonyms ("gross margin" ↔
   "gross profit percentage"), resolve relative time ("last three years" → fiscal years via
   `fiscal_calendars`), decompose explanation questions into sub-queries.
3. **Routing** (RAG-030) — `FINANCIAL_METRIC` is answered from `financial_metrics` (Phase 1c) via
   the tool layer, **never** through vector/keyword search.
4. **Retrieval** (`retrieval.py`, RAG-010…018) — vector + keyword search over the rewritten query
   and its sub-queries → **RRF fusion** (`fusion.py`, k=60) → **boilerplate dedup** (keep the
   latest of a `dedup_hash` cluster, annotate "unchanged since") → **rerank** (`rerank.py`) →
   **diversity cap** (≤ `rag_max_chunks_per_document`) + **time-aware** selection (recency boost
   for "latest"; one chunk per fiscal year for "over time") → **parent-child expansion** (attach
   sibling-section context; the citation stays the small child span).
5. **Context assembly** (`assembly.py`, RAG-020) — per-intent token budget; order structured
   metrics first, then Tier 1 evidence, then lower tiers; every evidence item wrapped in untrusted
   markers with its `source_id` + metadata.
6. **Sufficiency** (RAG-018) — if the top rerank score is below `rag_sufficiency_min_score`, the
   pipeline abstains (`sufficient=False`) rather than forcing a weak answer.
7. **Logging** — every call recorded to `retrieval_logs` (query, intent, top_k, scores, latency,
   chunk/source IDs) for the Phase 5b eval harness.

## Reranker (ADR-0014)

`LexicalReranker` (default) is deterministic and offline: stemmed query-term overlap blended with
the RRF prior, nudged by bounded tier/recency multipliers, normalized to `[0, 1]`.
`rag_rerank_enabled=False` falls back to `IdentityReranker` (pure fusion order) for latency
comparison. An LLM/cross-encoder reranker can slot in behind the `Reranker` ABC; Phase 5b evals
decide whether to switch. Because the lexical score floors near ~0.35 for zero-overlap hits (mock
embeddings return neighbors regardless of relevance), `rag_sufficiency_min_score` defaults to 0.4;
re-tune it per reranker.

## Tool layer (`tools.py`, RAG-031)

Typed, read-only, company-scoped tools, each returning a dict with `source_ids`:
`get_company_info`, `get_financial_metric`, `get_metric_series`, `calculate_growth` (delegates to
the deterministic finance layer — the LLM never computes), `get_recent_news`, `get_stock_history`.
`ToolRunner` enforces the per-question call budget (`rag_max_tool_calls`), detects loops (same
tool+args ≥ 3×), and logs every call with latency. P2 tools (`get_filing_diff`,
`get_insider_transactions`, `compare_companies`) are deferred.

## Prompt-injection defense (`injection.py`, RAG-040)

Retrieved text is data, never instructions. Phase 2a already stripped hidden HTML (DP-004). Here
every evidence span is wrapped in `<<<UNTRUSTED_SOURCE>>> … <<<END_UNTRUSTED_SOURCE>>>` markers
with a preamble that content between markers must never be followed; forged markers and control
chars are neutralized. The system/developer instruction is returned separately from the untrusted
block so the two are never concatenated into one instruction role. A red-team test confirms an
injected "ignore all previous instructions" chunk is wrapped as data and does not change pipeline
behavior.

## Config knobs

`rag_candidate_top_n` (40), `rag_rerank_top_k` (10), `rag_rrf_k` (60), `rag_rerank_enabled`,
`rag_sufficiency_min_score` (0.4), `rag_max_chunks_per_document` (3), `rag_context_token_budget`
(6000, scaled per intent), `rag_max_tool_calls` (6), `rag_tool_timeout_s` (10),
`llm_model_cheap`/`llm_model_strong` (model routing, RAG-050; the strong model is first used in
Phase 3).

## Deferred (first caller is Phase 3)

Semantic cache keyed on (company, normalized question embedding, data_version) (RAG-050) — the
hooks live in config/model routing, but the Redis-backed cache is built with its first real caller
in Phase 3c. A dedicated tool-call audit table (beyond structured logs) lands with Phase 5c
observability.
