# Agent Instructions - Prompt Template

Copy everything below the line into a new session and fill in the `<...>` placeholders.
One task file per session. Before starting: make sure **Docker Desktop is running** (integration
tests and migrations need Postgres: `docker compose up -d postgres redis`) and that `uv` is
installed.

---

Act as a Staff-level Software Engineer (Stripe / Meta caliber) with deep expertise in
full-stack, AI/LLM systems (RAG, citations, evals), and fintech data correctness.

CONTEXT:
- Project: Assay Desk. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/conventions.md` first; they are binding.
- Stack is decided in `docs/decisions/` (ADRs). Don't re-choose anything an ADR already settles.
  New ADRs take the next number after the highest file there.
- Backend: Python 3.12 via `uv` (`cd backend && uv run ...`); FastAPI; SQLAlchemy 2 + Alembic
  (migrations in `infrastructure/migrations/versions/`); Postgres 16 + pgvector + Redis via
  `docker compose`; Celery for jobs. Frontend: React + TS (Vite), TanStack Query, Zod, npm.
  E2E: Playwright in `e2e/` (tier 2, not in `make check`; runs against the dev stack).
- The gate is `make check` (ruff + ruff format --check + mypy --strict + pytest, eslint + tsc +
  vitest). It MUST pass before the task is done. It takes ~7 minutes; CI also enforces 80%
  overall coverage and 100% on `app/finance/*` and `app/citation/*`.
- Full spec: `docs/AssayDesk_Spec_v2.md`. Read ONLY the sections the task file cites. Phase 7
  requirement IDs go in its Appendix H.
- Current state: <e.g. "Phases 0–6, the UI rebuild and 7a (alerts v2) done; 7b next">

TASK:
Implement `Instructions/<NN_task_file>.md`.

BEFORE CODING:
1. Confirm every Prerequisite in the task file is done (check the DB/code, don't assume). If one
   isn't, stop and tell me.
2. Check the open-items list (`Instructions/TODO.md`) and the deferred-items backlog (your
   memory) for items that fall in this task's scope; pull them in and tick them off. Check
   `git status`/`git log` first: I commit between sessions, so don't assume what is uncommitted.
3. If the task leaves a decision open, check `docs/decisions/` first; if undecided, make the call
   and write a one-paragraph ADR (`docs/decisions/0000-adr-template.md`). Ask me only if it's
   costly to reverse (paid provider, data model, auth, security, public-launch licensing).
4. Give a 3–5 bullet plan before writing code.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Design: modular, minimalist, contract-first. Build only what the task file scopes. Match the
   existing folder structure (spec §32) and the patterns already in the repo; reuse existing
   helpers and registries (e.g. alert event types register in `app/alerts/registry.py`).
2. Code quality: strict typing, DRY, SOLID, small focused files/functions. Self-documenting
   names; comment only non-obvious logic and cite spec IDs (e.g. `DR-022`, `FR-AL-007`).
3. Financial correctness: `Decimal`/`NUMERIC` for money, never `float` (float is fine only for
   non-financial signals like similarity scores). Fiscal periods are separate from calendar
   dates. No LLM-generated numbers. No AI claim without a backend-issued source ID. A metric
   that's N/A or uncomputable is stored as NULL + a reason code, never 0.
4. Reliability: every external call goes through `HardenedHttpClient` (timeout, retry+backoff+
   jitter, circuit breaker, structured logging, host allowlist/SSRF) and has a mock. Ingestion
   records an `ingestion_runs` row, dead-letters bad records (`ingestion_dead_letters`), and
   isolates per-item failure (SAVEPOINT / per-item try) so one failure never aborts the batch.
   Update `data_freshness` for the source. Make everything idempotent (ING-001). Never fail
   silently: surface and log every degradation.
5. Security: validate input (bound free-text lengths); secrets only via env/config, never in
   code, URLs, or logs (auth tokens go in headers); treat filings/news/transcripts as untrusted
   data, never instructions. User-owned resources answer 404 (not 403) to other users.
6. Performance: no N+1s; batch/bulk DB writes; cache where the spec says to.
7. API handlers that take a DB session are `def` and use `Depends(get_db, scope="function")`
   (`test_database_handlers_cannot_stall_the_api` enforces it).
8. Tests: unit tests run fully OFFLINE (`PROVIDER_MODE=mock`, no network) against mocks/
   fixtures; integration tests use the test-DB fixtures and skip when Postgres is down. Each
   test references at least one requirement ID. Use `Decimal` equality for NUMERIC columns, not
   string comparison. API tests that hit committing handlers patch
   `session.commit` → `session.flush` so the fixture rollback cleans up. Rows inserted in one
   test transaction share Postgres `now()`: give "later" events explicit timestamps.

PROVIDER / INGESTION PHASES — reuse the established recipe:
- A `*Source` abstraction (ABC) with a live impl and a mock impl, switched by a `get_*_source()`
  factory on `PROVIDER_MODE` plus the per-source switch where one exists (`PRICE_PROVIDER`,
  `NEWS_PROVIDER`, `LLM_PROVIDER`, `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`); live impls RAISE a clear error if
  their API key is missing.
- Repositories own all SQL (idempotent upserts: `ON CONFLICT`, or delete-per-company+insert;
  beware Postgres treats NULLs as distinct in UNIQUE — a nullable key column breaks upsert).
- A thin pipeline orchestrates source → repos → freshness → run tracking.
- A `scripts/ingest_*.py` runner (give it a real arg parser; `--help` must not ingest).
- Verify a KEYLESS live source for real (like SEC EDGAR); for a key-gated source (Tiingo/
  Finnhub) unit-test the response parsing via `httpx.MockTransport` with sample JSON and note
  that live needs a key.

FRONTEND PHASES:
- Dark-first, minimalist, Robinhood/TradingView-style; follow `Instructions/UI_plan/00_README.md`
  and the existing `components/ui/*` primitives. Explicit loading, empty and error states.
- Validate every API response with Zod (`lib/schemas.ts`); types come from
  `src/services/api.d.ts` (`make openapi`).
- Check the change in the running app (screenshot the new screen), and add or update a
  Playwright spec; mock API routes with `page.route` where the data isn't in the dev DB.

DEV ENVIRONMENT (gotchas):
- Start the stack when app work begins: `docker compose up -d postgres redis`; API
  `cd backend && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`; frontend
  `cd frontend && npm run dev`; worker (only if jobs are needed)
  `uv run celery -A app.tasks.celery_app worker -Q interactive,ingestion,batch --pool solo`.
  Start each server in its own background call. Tear everything down when I say stop.
- After a migration, also run `cd backend && uv run alembic upgrade head` on the dev DB.
- Never run two pytest sessions at once (they share and recreate one test DB).
- Don't run `make seed` on the dev DB (it overwrites the live SEC/price data). After changing
  metric source ids or the builder, rebuild with `uv run python ../scripts/build_metrics.py`.
- Don't pipe coverage gates through `tail` (it hides the exit code).

CONSTRAINTS:
- No new dependencies unless necessary; justify each (why stdlib/an existing dep won't do). A
  major dep gets an ADR.
- Any schema/DB change ships a new Alembic migration (with a tested up/down) AND updates
  `docs/database.md` (migration history + any rule) in the same change. Any API change updates
  `docs/api.md` + regenerates `docs/openapi.json` and the client (`make openapi`).
- Don't break existing functionality. Finish by running `make check` until it's green; paste the
  result. (Common fixes: run `uv run ruff format` after writing files; `dict`→`dict[str, Any]`
  for mypy --strict; narrow `Optional` before use in tests; `# noqa` for intentional asserts/
  placeholder secrets in scripts.)
- Never commit or push; leave changes uncommitted unless I explicitly ask in that request.

OUTPUT:
1. The 3–5 bullet plan (before coding).
2. The implementation, file by file.
3. A summary of what changed and why, and any correctness bug you caught.
4. The task's Definition of Done checklist, each item ✅/❌ with evidence (test name, query
   output, file path).
5. Anything intentionally left out, with tradeoffs — added to the deferred-items backlog and
   `Instructions/TODO.md`.

If the task is ambiguous in a way that changes the outcome, ask me 1–2 clarifying questions
first instead of guessing.
